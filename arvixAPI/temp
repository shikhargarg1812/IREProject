    <title>ACtuAL: Actor-Critic Under Adversarial Learning</title>
    <summary>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful framework for deep
generative modeling. Posed as a two-player minimax problem, GANs are typically
trained end-to-end on real-valued data and can be used to train a generator of
high-dimensional and realistic images. However, a major limitation of GANs is
that training relies on passing gradients from the discriminator through the
generator via back-propagation. This makes it fundamentally difficult to train
GANs with discrete data, as generation in this case typically involves a
non-differentiable function. These difficulties extend to the reinforcement
learning setting when the action space is composed of discrete decisions. We
address these issues by reframing the GAN framework so that the generator is no
longer trained using gradients through the discriminator, but is instead
trained using a learned critic in the actor-critic framework with a Temporal
Difference (TD) objective. This is a natural fit for sequence modeling and we
use it to achieve improvements on language modeling tasks over the standard
Teacher-Forcing methods.

    <title>Learning to Run with Actor-Critic Ensemble</title>
    <summary>  We introduce an Actor-Critic Ensemble(ACE) method for improving the
performance of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG) algorithm. At inference
time, our method uses a critic ensemble to select the best action from
proposals of multiple actors running in parallel. By having a larger candidate
set, our method can avoid actions that have fatal consequences, while staying
deterministic. Using ACE, we have won the 2nd place in NIPS'17 Learning to Run
competition, under the name of "Megvii-hzwer".

    <title>Curious Hierarchical Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Hierarchical abstraction and curiosity-driven exploration are two common
paradigms in current reinforcement learning approaches to break down difficult
problems into a sequence of simpler ones and to overcome reward sparsity.
However, there is a lack of approaches that combine these paradigms, and it is
currently unknown whether curiosity also helps to perform the hierarchical
abstraction. As a novelty and scientific contribution, we tackle this issue and
develop a method that combines hierarchical reinforcement learning with
curiosity. Herein, we extend a contemporary hierarchical actor-critic approach
with a forward model to develop a hierarchical notion of curiosity. We
demonstrate in several continuous-space environments that curiosity can more
than double the learning performance and success rates for most of the
investigated benchmarking problems. We also provide our source code and a
supplementary video.

    <title>Potential Field Guided Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we consider the problem of actor-critic reinforcement
learning. Firstly, we extend the actor-critic architecture to actor-critic-N
architecture by introducing more critics beyond rewards. Secondly, we combine
the reward-based critic with a potential-field-based critic to formulate the
proposed potential field guided actor-critic reinforcement learning approach
(actor-critic-2). This can be seen as a combination of the model-based
gradients and the model-free gradients in policy improvement. State with large
potential field often contains a strong prior information, such as pointing to
the target at a long distance or avoiding collision by the side of an obstacle.
In this situation, we should trust potential-field-based critic more as policy
evaluation to accelerate policy improvement, where action policy tends to be
guided. For example, in practical application, learning to avoid obstacles
should be guided rather than learned by trial and error. State with small
potential filed is often lack of information, for example, at the local minimum
point or around the moving target. At this time, we should trust reward-based
critic as policy evaluation more to evaluate the long-term return. In this
case, action policy tends to explore. In addition, potential field evaluation
can be combined with planning to estimate a better state value function. In
this way, reward design can focus more on the final stage of reward, rather
than reward shaping or phased reward. Furthermore, potential field evaluation
can make up for the lack of communication in multi-agent cooperation problem,
i.e., multi-agent each has a reward-based critic and a relative unified
potential-field-based critic with prior information. Thirdly, simplified
experiments on predator-prey game demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

    <title>Online Meta-Critic Learning for Off-Policy Actor-Critic Methods</title>
    <summary>  Off-Policy Actor-Critic (Off-PAC) methods have proven successful in a variety
of continuous control tasks. Normally, the critic's action-value function is
updated using temporal-difference, and the critic in turn provides a loss for
the actor that trains it to take actions with higher expected return. In this
paper, we introduce a novel and flexible meta-critic that observes the learning
process and meta-learns an additional loss for the actor that accelerates and
improves actor-critic learning. Compared to the vanilla critic, the meta-critic
network is explicitly trained to accelerate the learning process; and compared
to existing meta-learning algorithms, meta-critic is rapidly learned online for
a single task, rather than slowly over a family of tasks. Crucially, our
meta-critic framework is designed for off-policy based learners, which
currently provide state-of-the-art reinforcement learning sample efficiency. We
demonstrate that online meta-critic learning leads to improvements in avariety
of continuous control environments when combined with contemporary Off-PAC
methods DDPG, TD3 and the state-of-the-art SAC.

    <title>Reinforcement Learning through Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic on a
  GPU</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a hybrid CPU/GPU version of the Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, currently the state-of-the-art method in
reinforcement learning for various gaming tasks. We analyze its computational
traits and concentrate on aspects critical to leveraging the GPU's
computational power. We introduce a system of queues and a dynamic scheduling
strategy, potentially helpful for other asynchronous algorithms as well. Our
hybrid CPU/GPU version of A3C, based on TensorFlow, achieves a significant
speed up compared to a CPU implementation; we make it publicly available to
other researchers at https://github.com/NVlabs/GA3C .

    <title>Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning with Simultaneous Human Control and
  Feedback</title>
    <summary>  This paper contributes a first study into how different human users deliver
simultaneous control and feedback signals during human-robot interaction. As
part of this work, we formalize and present a general interactive learning
framework for online cooperation between humans and reinforcement learning
agents. In many human-machine interaction settings, there is a growing gap
between the degrees-of-freedom of complex semi-autonomous systems and the
number of human control channels. Simple human control and feedback mechanisms
are required to close this gap and allow for better collaboration between
humans and machines on complex tasks. To better inform the design of concurrent
control and feedback interfaces, we present experimental results from a
human-robot collaborative domain wherein the human must simultaneously deliver
both control and feedback signals to interactively train an actor-critic
reinforcement learning robot. We compare three experimental conditions: 1)
human delivered control signals, 2) reward-shaping feedback signals, and 3)
simultaneous control and feedback. Our results suggest that subjects provide
less feedback when simultaneously delivering feedback and control signals and
that control signal quality is not significantly diminished. Our data suggest
that subjects may also modify when and how they provide feedback. Through
algorithmic development and tuning informed by this study, we expect
semi-autonomous actions of robotic agents can be better shaped by human
feedback, allowing for seamless collaboration and improved performance in
difficult interactive domains.

    <title>Cohesion-based Online Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for mHealth
  Intervention</title>
    <summary>  In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide, mobile
health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide
influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and
portable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods
for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no
information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However,
data for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online
learning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides,
we find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and
connected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method
for mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar
users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned
policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic
RL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method
in all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective
policies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm
start trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization
of our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised
learning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we
propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the
proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related
tasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that
in a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

    <title>Asymmetric Actor Critic for Image-Based Robot Learning</title>
    <summary>  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has proven a powerful technique in many
sequential decision making domains. However, Robotics poses many challenges for
RL, most notably training on a physical system can be expensive and dangerous,
which has sparked significant interest in learning control policies using a
physics simulator. While several recent works have shown promising results in
transferring policies trained in simulation to the real world, they often do
not fully utilize the advantage of working with a simulator. In this work, we
exploit the full state observability in the simulator to train better policies
which take as input only partial observations (RGBD images). We do this by
employing an actor-critic training algorithm in which the critic is trained on
full states while the actor (or policy) gets rendered images as input. We show
experimentally on a range of simulated tasks that using these asymmetric inputs
significantly improves performance. Finally, we combine this method with domain
randomization and show real robot experiments for several tasks like picking,
pushing, and moving a block. We achieve this simulation to real world transfer
without training on any real world data.

    <title>Diff-DAC: Distributed Actor-Critic for Average Multitask Deep
  Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  We propose a fully distributed actor-critic algorithm approximated by deep
neural networks, named \textit{Diff-DAC}, with application to single-task and
to average multitask reinforcement learning (MRL). Each agent has access to
data from its local task only, but it aims to learn a policy that performs well
on average for the whole set of tasks. During the learning process, agents
communicate their value-policy parameters to their neighbors, diffusing the
information across the network, so that they converge to a common policy, with
no need for a central node. The method is scalable, since the computational and
communication costs per agent grow with its number of neighbors. We derive
Diff-DAC's from duality theory and provide novel insights into the standard
actor-critic framework, showing that it is actually an instance of the dual
ascent method that approximates the solution of a linear program. Experiments
suggest that Diff-DAC can outperform the single previous distributed MRL
approach (i.e., Dist-MTLPS) and even the centralized architecture.
